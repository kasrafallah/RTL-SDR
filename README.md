# RTL-SDR 
## (implementing FM radio using Matlab with GUI user interface for better view)

### important note: it's better to use Matlab 2014B for running this code


I'm kasra Fallah, last year student of electrical engineering at sharif university of technology.
in this project, I make a radio FM broadcast player with Matlab real-time processing.
for using this code you need an antenna and 2014a matlab version with rtl-sdr matlab
